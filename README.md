# StockAnn
Ok hear me out... A neural network built to predict and act upon stock markets.

# The gist
So im gonna make a custom RL (reinforced learning) algorithm for a neural network and create a game in unity to test it with.

once i have a "working" model ill release it to the public along with the game. however the full version will be for my personal use only. **DO NOT EXPECT SOMETHING GOOD** im not exactly the best with neural nets so go easy.
